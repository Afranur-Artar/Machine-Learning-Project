# Machine Learning 

Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

* In machine learning, a target is called a label.
* In statistics, a target is called a dependent variable.
* A variable in statistics is called a feature in machine learning.
* A transformation in statistics is called feature creation in machine learning.

Two of the most widely adopted machine learning methods are "supervised learning" and "unsupervised learning" and the rest of them is "Semisupervised learning", "Reinforcement learning"

### Supervised Learning Algorithms
They are trained using labeled examples, such as an input where the desired output is known. For example, a piece of equipment could have data points labeled either “F” (failed) or “R” (runs). The learning algorithm receives a set of inputs along with the corresponding correct outputs, and the algorithm learns by comparing its actual output with correct outputs to find errors. It contains regression problems and classification problems. If the target variable is continuous, it is called regression problems; if the target labeled is categorical, is called classification problems
